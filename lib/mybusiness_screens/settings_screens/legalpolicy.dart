    <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>

    <p>These terms and conditions (“Terms”) govern the use of or access to http://www.lezrapp.com (“Website”), the “LezrApp” mobile application (“App”), and the Services (defined below). The Website and App are collectively referred to as the “Platform”.</p>
    
    <p>These Terms also include our privacy policy, available at <a href="https://okcredit.in/privacy">https://okcredit.in/privacy</a>, and any guidelines, additional terms, policies, or disclaimers made available or issued by us from time to time. These Terms may be updated by us, without notice to you and the Terms, as amended, shall apply to you from time to time. You can always review the most current version of these Terms on the Platform.</p>
    
    <p>These Terms constitute a binding and enforceable legal contract between Ethought Technologies Private Limited (“LezrApp”) and a User (defined below) or any end user of the Services (collectively, “you”). You represent and warrant that you (a) have full legal capacity and authority to agree and bind yourself to these Terms, (b) are eighteen years of age or older, and (c) are an Indian resident. If you represent an entity, organisation, or any other legal person, you confirm and represent that you have the necessary power and authority to bind such entity, organisation, or legal person to these Terms.</p>
    
    <p>By using the Services, you agree that you have read, understood, and are bound by these Terms, and that you comply with the requirements listed herein. If you do not agree to all of these Terms or comply with the requirements herein, please do not access the Platform or use the Services.</p>

    <h2>1. Services</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The Platform allows small businesses such as vendors, merchants, and suppliers (hereafter, “Merchants”) to record their daily transactions, such as the sale and purchase of goods and services, with their customers (“Customers”). In addition, the Platform uses technology to facilitate transactions between Merchants and Customers and uses data-backed insights to meet Users’ untapped needs. Further, LezrApp facilitates the provision of financial products and services to Users (all the services described here, including the provision of the Platform and its features, collectively constitute the “Services”).</li>
        <li>Merchants and Customers are collectively referred to as “Users”. For the avoidance of doubt, a Merchant may be considered a Customer in certain transactions (and vice versa). For example, in a situation where the Merchant purchases goods and services from a supplier that are recorded on the Platform, the Merchant would be considered a Customer and the supplier a Merchant.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Profile Creation</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>To avail the Services, a Merchant would be required to create a merchant profile on the Platform (“Profile”). In addition to setting up username and password to create the Profile, the Merchant will be required to furnish certain details, including but not limited to phone numbers and details of their businesses. The Merchant warrants that all information furnished in connection with its Profile is and shall remain accurate and true in all respect, and agrees that it shall promptly update its details on the Platform in the event of any change or modification.</li>
        <li>The Merchant is solely responsible for maintaining the security and confidentiality of its username and password, and agrees to immediately notify LezrApp of any disclosure or unauthorised use of its Profile or any other breach of security with respect to its Profile.</li>
        <li>The Merchant expressly agrees to be liable and accountable for all activities that take place through its Profile. LezrApp shall in no manner be held liable for any unauthorised access to a Merchant’s Profile.</li>
        <li>The Merchant agrees to receive communications from LezrApp regarding: (i) information relating to transactions recorded on the Platform; (ii) requests for payment; (iii) information about LezrApp and the Services; (iv) promotional offers and services from LezrApp and its third-party partners, and (v) any other matter in relation to the Services.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. KYC</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>LezrApp may be required to undertake certain “know your customer” processes in relation to Users who intend to avail certain features of the Services. In this regard, LezrApp from time to time shall require Users to upload information and documents that may be necessary to ascertain their eligibility to use certain features of the Services (“KYC Documents”).</li>
        <li>The User authorises LezrApp, and any third-party service provider it may engage with, to process KYC Documents and ascertain its eligibility. Any processing undertaken by LezrApp shall be in accordance with its Privacy Policy. The User agrees that it may be subject to additional terms of service in the event a third party processes information under this Clause. Further, In the event any additional information, data, or documentation is required to determine eligibility (collectively, “Additional Information”), the User hereby agrees to share such Additional Information promptly upon request, and further, authorises LezrApp to process such Additional Information.</li>
        <li>The User agrees and warrants to provide true, complete, and up-to-date KYC Documents and Additional Information. The User further acknowledges that (i) any false or misleading information provided in this regard shall constitute a material breach of these Terms, and (ii) its access to certain features of the Services may be limited or denied if it fails to share KYC Documents and Additional Information.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Transaction Information</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Merchants may upload information relating to transactions with Customers, including the sale of goods or services, costs, amounts paid and payable, and details of goods and services, on the Platform (such information is referred to as “Transaction Information”). Transaction Information may be exchanged between Merchants and Customers through telephonic calls, text message, WhatsApp, email, or other electronic mediums that would depend on the contact details of Merchants and Customers provided on the Platform.</li>
        <li>At the time of creating or uploading the first Transaction Information with respect to a Customer, the Merchant shall inform such Customer of its use of the Platform to record such Transaction Information and Transaction Information related to future transactions and seek such Customer’s express consent in this regard and to:
            <ul>
                <li>The creation of a profile of the Customer on the Platform, which will require sharing such Customer’s phone number and contact details with LezrApp;</li>
                <li>Receive communications from LezrApp regarding: (A) information relating to their transactions recorded on the Platform; (B) requests for payment; (C) information about LezrApp and the Services; (D) promotional offers and services from LezrApp and its third-party partners, and (E) any other matter in relation to the Services.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Should the Customer fail to provide consent, or withdraw consent, the Merchant shall immediately cease to use the Services in relation to that Customer.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Third Party Services</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The Services may include services, content, documents, and information owned by, licensed to, or otherwise made available by a third party (“Third Party Services”) or contain links to Third Party Services. Users understand that Third Party Services are the responsibility of the third party that created or provided it and acknowledge that use of such Third Party Services is solely at their own risk.</li>
        <li>LezrApp makes no representations and excludes all warranties and liabilities arising out of or pertaining to such Third Party Services, including their accuracy or completeness. Further, all intellectual property rights in and to Third Party Services are the property of the respective third parties.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Your Responsibilities</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The User represents and warrants that all information that is provided through or in relation to the Services is complete, true, and correct on the date of agreeing to these Terms and shall continue to be complete, true, and correct while the User avails the Services.

LezrApp does not accept any responsibility or liability for any loss or damage the User may suffer or incur if any information, documentation, material, or data provided to avail the Services is incorrect, incomplete, inaccurate, or misleading, or if the User fails to disclose any material fact.</li>
